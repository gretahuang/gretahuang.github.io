                "description": "Dogecache is a mobile-first web app inspired by the concept of Geocaching. In the game of Geocaching, people experience scavenger hunts by finding objects that are planted by other players, and at the same time they plant their own objects for people to find. It's a game about finding and giving. In Dogecache, people search for dogecoin in their area while giving away dogecoin. By searching the area around them, users can pick up dogecoin within their radius but also has to drop off dogecoin where they are located. This way, dogecoin is always kept in circulation of the Dogecache app, and the game never ends. This app was a hack made at the hackathon at Bergen County Academies. It won the \"Most Polished App\", in addition to \"Best Quality Design App\" by Intel. Dogecache was also given a special invitation to debut at NYC Techday, New York City's largest tech startup exhibition (and with Dogecache, it includes high schoolers for the first time)!",

People usually get highly motivated to do something one day, but then the next day lose that motivation. Chainge helps encourage and instill that motivation. By adding to the daily tasks list, users try to complete their daily tasks consistently and maintain a chain of the number of days they completed their tasks. By adding on to this chainand completing their tasks without fail, users can feel rewarded in their progress by leveling up. The calendar keeps a visual archive of tasks completed on certain days and displays the chains of tasks that were completed daily. Chainge also has a reminders list that can help a user track events to come or things to complete that may not be daily. The reminders can also be sorted by category - Hobbies, Education, or Fitness.

By planting various plants around and maintaining them, people can protect local watersheds and keep them clean, ultimately preserving our ecosystem. In order to keep fluid maintenance of the plants planted around the Bay Area, employees and community members need some efficient way to communicate what various plants need, who will maintain them, and how they will be maintained. The Watershed App, for both iOS and Android (personally worked on the iOS app), allows users to do all that. It allows them to keep track of the status of plants planted around the Bay Area and lets managers easily distribute tasks to users. The app is still currently under development and will be put on the App Store / Play Store.",

For example, if the user chooses happy, the app would look for tweets that contain words like happy, great, win, or good. When the app finds those words in tweets, the tweets are mapped to a certain musical note, and as a result the app plays a live melody of tweets.",

The process involved first solving differential equations to make a predictive/perliminary equations on railgun efficiency, building a railgun from scratch, testing the projectile's output efficiency and comparing predictions to results, and finally adjusting the existing preliminary model made specifically to accurately predict railgun efficiency.

                "description": "This project saw the creation of a new type of prosthetic arm for people in developing countries. Standard prosthetic arms, even the simple hook-arms that many amputees use, cost lots of money (thousands of dollars at the least) due to customization needs and investment of time in transitioning to using these often uneasy-to-use gripping mechanisms. Most importantly, prosthetic arms are only dreams to those, especially in developing countries, who lack the money or resources to purchase one. This new prosthetic arm (for below-elbow amputations) has an adjustable mount and an intuitive gripping mechanism, the granular jammer. Granular jamming works by using grains inside a flexible membrane and pressing the membrane against the object. After switching on a vacuum to suck the air out of the membrane, it conforms to the objects shape and can easily grip it. Not only is the arm adjustable to different sizes amputations, but it is easy to use and cost less than 100 dollars to build. This project won 1st place at the Jersey Shore Science Fair, New Jersey Academy of Sciences, Monmouth Junior Science Symposium, and 3rd place at the Delaware Valley Science Fair. This arm design is currently patent-pending.",

Two identical pinewood derby cars were the small-scale model vehicles used for the experiment, and each was modified with a layer of clay on top. However, while one car had a smooth surface, the other had a dimpled surface on the clay. The times it took for the dimpled car to reach the finish line were compared to those for the smooth car, and results showed that the dimpled car was able to travel faster than the smooth car, ultimately reducing the drag force that resisted the car's motion. This project won 3rd place at the Jersey Shore Science Fair in Physics.",
