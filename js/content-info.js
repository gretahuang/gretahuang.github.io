This drug had implications in the treatment of meningeal and pulmonary Cryptococcosis, a fungal disease. These gold nanoparticles were evaluated for efficacy as a drug delivery system for treatment of meningeal and pulmonary Cryptococcosis. This project took 1st place at the New York Science and Engineering Fair.

This study combined these two findings and created a methodology for synthesis of a folate coated platinum nanoparticle. The novel nanoparticle was investigated for uptake in breast cancer cells and effectiveness in selective elimination of cancerous cells. The study additionally explored an Atomic Force Microscopy method for cancer detection at the single cell level on basis of differences in cellular rigidity of cancerous and non-cancerous cells.
